# Cpp-UniProjects
These are the Cpp files for projects I have completed as a part of my university's C++ courses. The labs, are fairy simple object based implementations.
The files titled pa(number here).cpp are larger, more challenging *Personal Assignments* 
1. pa1.cpp is an alien game, which tracks movement, health, and attacks of aliens.
2. pa2.cpp is a recursive 'box filler'. It recursively fills a 2x2, 4x4, and 8x8 (depending on what the user has selected), with L shaped letters.
3. pa3.cpp mimics the review system at my University, known as USTspace. It uses fairly complex linked lists, insertion, deletion.
